## Course Description
This seminar will introduce you to graduate study at Cornell and foster community among first-year graduate students. The course will orient you to the PhD program, providing advice about coursework, exams, and teaching. It will also introduce you to campus resources housed in the Cornell Library and the Graduate School. Additionally, we will discuss issues related to professional development, including conference presentations, grant applications, article publishing, applying to academic jobs, and careers beyond academia. You will complete one brief, informal presentation for this class and are required to meet with me one-on-one at least once during the semester; otherwise, there are no required reading and no writing assignments for this class.
